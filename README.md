# üß† Virtual Memory Scheduler

**A C++ simulation of virtual memory management with process scheduling.**

This project models an operating system‚Äôs **memory management** and **job scheduling** system. It simulates virtual memory allocation, page handling, and execution of jobs based on instruction files.

---

## üìå Project Overview

The **Virtual Memory Scheduler** performs the following:

* Simulates virtual memory with **fixed-size physical memory** and larger **virtual address space**.
* Handles **page allocation** and **deallocation**, including **page faults**.
* Implements **job scheduling** and executes instructions sequentially.
* Supports structured **input files** with job instructions and data sections.

This project demonstrates **operating system concepts**, **C++ programming skills**, and **problem-solving** in system-level simulations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

* **Virtual Memory Management**: Allocates and tracks pages in physical memory.
* **Process Scheduling**: Executes jobs sequentially or via round-robin.
* **Instruction Handling**: Supports LR, CR, BT, PD, H commands.
* **File I/O**: Reads job instructions and data from structured input files.
* **Output Logging**: Detailed execution logs for each instruction and job.

## üß© System Architecture

**Modules:**

| Module                   | Functionality                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Input Parser**         | Parses `$AMJ`, `$DTA`, `$END` sections and instructions.                 |
| **Instruction Executor** | Executes instructions: LR, CR, BT, PD, H. Updates memory/register state. |
| **Memory Manager**       | Tracks physical memory, allocates pages, handles page faults.            |
| **Scheduler**            | Manages execution order of multiple jobs.                                |
| **Output Logger**        | Prints results and job completion status.                                |
